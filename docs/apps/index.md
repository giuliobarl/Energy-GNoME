# Database Dashboards

To facilitate easy access to the results of our proposed Energy-GNoME [protocol](../about_db/index.md){.wiki-hover}, we offer a comprehensive package that includes the project code and database, available on both [GitHub][1] and [Zenodo][2]. Additionally, we have developed an intuitive web app dashboard.

This dashboard provides an accessible interface for screening, analyzing, and downloading both the database and the crystal structures it contains. It is designed to serve researchers from diverse backgrounds, making the data our GNoME project easily usable for energy applications such as [:gnome-battery: cathodes](#cathode-materials){.wiki-hover}, [:gnome-perovskite: perovskites](#perovskite-materials){.wiki-hover}, and [:gnome-thermoelectrics: thermoelectrics](#thermoelectric-materials){.wiki-hover}.
