# How to use the *Perovskite* materials dashboard

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

The Perovskite materials dashboard empowers you to explore candidate perovskite materials from the Energy-GNoME database. This interactive tool enables detailed filtering, ranking, and analysis of materials based on their properties and AI-predicted metrics.

## 1. Interactive Sidebar for Model Selection and Filtering

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

The Control Panel on the left sidebar provides powerful filtering and model selection capabilities:
- Property Filters: Use sliders to adjust thresholds for key material properties, such as:
    * Average Band Gap (eV): Average band gap predicted by the ensemble committee of four E3NN models. Focus on materials with specific electronic properties.
    * AI-Experts Confidence (-): Confidence level of the ensemble committee of ten GBDT models in classifying the material as a perovskite.Filter materials based on the reliability of AI predictions.
    * Formation Energy (eV/atom): Identify stable candidates by setting energy ranges.
    * Volume (Å³): Narrow down results by the physical size or unit cell volume of materials.
    * Density (Å³/atom): Filter based on material density.
