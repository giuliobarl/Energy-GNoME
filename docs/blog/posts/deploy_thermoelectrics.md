The Energy-GNoME Thermoelectric Database is a modern resource designed to accelerate thermoelectric material discovery by leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and iterative active learning. This tailored dataset highlights **promising candidates with high thermoelectric performance**, providing detailed predictions of their properties, including the figure of merit \(zT\), empowering researchers to innovate with greater speed and precision.

## Why Focus on Thermoelectrics?

Thermoelectric materials stand out for their unique ability to directly convert heat into electricity, making them essential for:

- **Energy Efficiency:** Recovery of waste heat from industrial processes and engines.
- **Compact Cooling Solutions:** Solid-state cooling for electronics and medical devices.
- **Sustainability:** Enabling greener and more energy-efficient systems by reducing thermal waste.

However, identifying high-performing thermoelectric materials is a significant challenge due to the complex interplay of properties required for a high \(zT\). This is where Energy-GNoME's data-driven approach provides a transformative advantage.

## Applications and Impact

The Energy-GNoME Thermoelectric Database opens new possibilities for breakthroughs in energy harvesting and cooling technologies by:

- Accelerating the discovery of materials with high \(zT\) values at various working temperatures.
- Providing a resource for optimizing thermal, electronic, and mechanical properties simultaneously.

By offering detailed predictions and enabling faster material screening, the Thermoelectric Database empowers researchers to focus on innovation rather than data collection and preliminary analyses.

## Contribute to the Project

We invite the materials science community to explore, utilize, and contribute to the Energy-GNoME Thermoelectric Database. Your feedback and collaboration will help us refine and expand this valuable resource, propelling the next generation of thermoelectric technologies.
