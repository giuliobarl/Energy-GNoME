The Energy-GNoME Perovskite Database is a modern resource designed to accelerate perovskite material discovery by leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and iterative active learning. This tailored dataset highlights **promising candidates for photovoltaic applications** and provides detailed predictions of their properties, empowering researchers to innovate with greater speed and precision.

## Why Focus on Perovskites?

Perovskites stand out for their unique crystalline structure, which enables:

- **High Efficiency**: Exceptional performance in photovoltaics.
- **Flexibility**: Tunable properties for diverse applications (e.g., single-junction or tandem solar cells).
- **Sustainability**: Potential for low-cost and scalable synthesis.

However, the vast chemical space of perovskites makes finding optimal candidates a significant challenge. That’s where Energy-GNoME’s data-driven approach proves transformative.

## Applications and Impact

The Energy-GNoME Perovskite Database opens new possibilities for breakthroughs in the Solar Energy field, accelerating the discovery of stable, lead-free perovskite compositions for high-efficiency photovoltaics.

By providing detailed predictions and enabling faster material screening, the Perovskite Database empowers researchers to focus on innovation rather than data collection and preliminary analyses.

## Contribute to the Project

We invite the materials science community to explore, utilize, and contribute to the Energy-GNoME Perovskite Database. Your feedback and collaboration will help us refine and expand this valuable resource, propelling the next generation of perovskite-based technologies.
