# **The Energy-GNoME Cathode Database is Now Available**

We are thrilled to introduce the dedicated **Cathode Database** within the Energy-GNoME platform. Cathode materials are at the heart of modern battery technologies, playing a critical role in enabling efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions. From lithium-ion to emerging multivalent systems, the search for optimal cathode materials is key to advancing the next generation of energy storage devices.

The Energy-GNoME Cathode Database is a modern resource designed to accelerate the discovery of high-performing cathode materials by leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques and iterative active learning. This specialized dataset focuses on materials featuring nine different monovalent and multivalent working ions: **Li**, **Na**, **Mg**, **K**, **Ca**, **Cs**, **Al**, **Rb**, and **Y**, providing detailed predictions for properties essential to battery performance.

## Why Focus on Cathode Materials?

Cathode materials are pivotal in determining the energy density, cycle life, and stability of batteries. To optimize these materials, we analyzed and predicted four critical properties:

- **Average Cathode Potential (\(\Delta V_c\)):** A key factor for energy density.
- **Maximum Relative Volume Difference (\(\max (\Delta \text{Vol})\)):** Influences the structural stability during cycling.
- **Stability of the Charged State (\(\Delta E_{\text{charge}}\)):** Ensures longevity in the charged condition.
- **Stability of the Discharged State (\(\Delta E_{\text{discharge}}\)):** Crucial for maintaining integrity after full discharge.

By predicting these properties, the Cathode Materials Database empowers researchers to identify materials with the right balance of performance, stability, and scalability.

## Applications and Impact

The Energy-GNoME Cathode Materials Database opens up exciting possibilities for advancing battery technologies, including:

- **Lithium and Post-Lithium Batteries:** Optimizing high-energy-density materials with excellent cycling stability.
- **Multivalent Systems:** Exploring alternative chemistries featuring Mg, Na, Ca, and other abundant elements.
- **Sustainability:** Identifying materials that reduce reliance on scarce or expensive elements while maintaining high performance.

This database enables faster material screening and more precise property predictions, helping researchers focus on innovation rather than data collection and preliminary analyses.

## Contribute to the Project

We invite the materials science and energy storage community to explore, utilize, and contribute to the Energy-GNoME Cathode Database. Your feedback and collaboration will help us refine this valuable resource, propelling the search for transformative battery materials.
