Energy-GNoME is designed to identify and predict materials for energy applications, including thermoelectrics, cathodes, and perovskites. Its core innovation lies in integrating ML techniques with an iterative active learning framework, enabling continuous evolution and refinement.

## Why Energy-GNoME Matters
Energy-GNoME represents a significant leap forward for energy material discovery:

1. **Accelerated Discovery**: By leveraging ML, it reduces the time and resources needed to identify high-potential materials.
2. **Versatile Applications**: Its protocol is tailored to support a wide range of energy applications, from thermoelectrics to next-generation batteries.
3. **Collaborative Growth**: Energy-GNoME is designed to grow with input from the broader material science and engineering communities.

## Whatâ€™s Next?
The 0.0.2 release of Energy-GNoME is just the beginning. Future updates will include:

* Enhanced predictive capabilities through expanded training datasets.
* Integration of additional material property datasets from experimental and computational sources.
* Broader community engagement to foster collaboration and feedback.

We invite **researchers**, **engineers**, and **scientists** to explore Energy-GNoME, contribute data, and join us in shaping the future of energy material discovery. Together, we can build a more sustainable and energy-efficient world.

Stay tuned for updates, and let's advance material science together with Energy-GNoME!
